Practicing writing JavaScript while building a 2D shooter game. <br>
\*This is not part of the Scriba material, extra-curricular

# Quick Start

This project is created in vanilla JS, to get it running:

1. Open index.html in a browser
2. To make the object move around the canvas press 'W', 'A', 'S' or 'D'
3. To shoot press 'left mouse button'
4. Press 'space' to pause/resume the game
